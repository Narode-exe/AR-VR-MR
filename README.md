# Unity ARFoundation with URP & shader graph( The Portal Gun )
The portal gun from sci-fi catoon series Rick & Morty in Augmented Reality.
### Overview & Agenda:
Agenda was to learn URP and shader graph in Unity. I took inspiration from the famous Sci-Fi cartoon series Rick & Morty and build
the portal using ARFoundation.
### The portal in Rick&Morty:
Portals allow travel between two different locations. Usually, these locations exist in the same universe. The only groups that have been known to use intergalactic portal technology are the Ricks and the Galactic Federation.

### Technologies used:
ARFoundation(3.1.3)

Universal render pipeline with shader graphs.
### Technologies used:
